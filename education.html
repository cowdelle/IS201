                        <p>Carbon High School 2019 - I went to high school at Carbon High School in Price, UT where I graduated as salutatorian. Even though my GPA was a 4.0 and ACT a 30, I'm still not sure I spelled salutatorian correctly. I had a lot of fun experiences in high school that taught me a lot. I was the Dance Sterling Scholar for our school. I was also a part of the theater department, choir, jazz band, concert band, symphonic band, FBLA, Quiz Bowl, Friends of Rachel, Seminary, Varsity soccer, and the swim team. My favorite classes to take were physics and dance.</p>
                        <p>Utah State University 2022 - I earned my Associates of General Studies degree from Utah State Universtiy while attending the Eastern campus. Because it is such a small campus, I was able to have a lot of great experiences and learn a lot from the faculty and staff. I started out my college career as a theatre major, so I was part of many musicals and plays at the university. Later, I switched to a business path, where I ended up being accepted into Utah State's Information Systems program. The professors in both areas were amazing and taught me a lot about their respective subjects as well as about life.</p>
                        <p>Brigham Young University Current - I am currently attending Brigham Young University where I am pursing my Bachelor of Information Systems degree. It has been quite the experience transfering to this university. It is very different from Utah State, but I have enjoyed my time here. I have loved living in close proximity to my best friends whom I met while serving a mission for my church. I have also enjoyed learning in the classes. At the conclusion of my first semester here, there are still a lot of things I want to grow to love, but I know that will take time.</p>
